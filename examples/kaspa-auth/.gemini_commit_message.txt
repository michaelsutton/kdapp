feat: Implement true P2P authentication and session management

This commit refactors the kaspa-auth application to fully adhere to the kdapp philosophy, ensuring the blockchain is the single source of truth for all authentication and session management.

Key changes include:
- **Deterministic Challenge Generation:** Challenges are now deterministically generated using `rand_chacha` seeded with blockchain-derived timestamps, resolving previous "Challenge mismatch" errors.
- **Deterministic Session Token Generation:** Session tokens are also deterministically generated, ensuring consistency across all peers and successful session revocation.
- **Blockchain-Only Challenge Retrieval:** The client-side HTTP fallback for challenge retrieval has been removed, forcing reliance on the blockchain for all challenge coordination.
- **Unified Episode State Management:** The `AuthEventHandler` has been refactored to remove its independent challenge state, ensuring the kdapp engine's episode state is the authoritative source.
- **Updated Documentation:** `GEMINI.md` and `CLAUDE.md` have been updated with critical rules and insights gained during the debugging process, emphasizing the "no faking, no shortcuts, blockchain is truth" principle.

This ensures a robust, truly decentralized authentication and session management system built on the Kaspa blockchain.
